# Arduino_TextToSpeechLCDdisplay
The summary of this group project is to create a text to speech program that allows a user to input numbers through the use of a keypad. Those numbers are displayed on the lcd screen. Afterwards, the program chooses a selection of sounds from a talkie library to create an audio recording that is then played back to the user through the use of speakers. This project works when all 3 files work in one program.
